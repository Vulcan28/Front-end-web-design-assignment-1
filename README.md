11056 Project 1: Responsive Website

Aim
Demonstrate that you can develop a professional website using semantic HTML, advanced CSS and responsive design techniques.

Refection

The premise of the assignment was to recreate the contour 556 website (found at https://www.contour556.com.au/) using our own html and css, in a form of our liking, this site had to be created to be responsive and designed in such a way that it could be viewed on multiple devices without problems.

I started with a basic lo-fi prototype of my index page as I reasoned that this would be the page that would take the most effort to create as it would have the most content to structure and format, it would also be the page on which I developed the base structure that would be used on all other pages on my website. This base structure consisted of the head, header, and footer as the content in the main of the page was to change with every page on the site. I started by developing the navbar as that was the first element that would be used across all of my pages and I immediately ran into problems with image overlapping and centring, these problems stemmed mainly from the fact that my page at the time wasn’t built on a grid system that would allow me to position content accordingly so at the time I was using float values and absolute positioning to arrange textboxes and my image which was causing problems with content moving out of place and overlapping with each other and quickly becoming an unintelligible mess.

Soon after I finished getting my index page into some form of mock-up of what I wanted it to be we learnt about grid systems which completely changed how I could position and move content around the page and allowed me to easily define areas for my content that would scale with the page and allow me to make more complex page designs. The first thing I did was trash my original navbar code and do a complete restructure of its code so I could incorporate it in my new grid system, this helped me to gain a base understanding of how-to layout and arrange my grid and some do’s and do nots when working with a grid system. I quickly applied this code to all of my pages creating the base that would be present on all pages on the website, I then started to work on main content of my index page.

This is where I ran into a major roadblock as I struggled to employ sub-grids and nested grids within my website, this prevented me from adding content to the main of each page separately causing me substantial problems, preventing me from progressing further into the assignment for quite some time causing significant setbacks and problems. I eventually worked past the problem with help from our unit convener and tutor wtich allowed me to start to add content to my index page and the rest of my pages with little to no problems.

Next I started work on my breakpoints and defining them on each page accordingly, this mostly involved me creating new grids that would override older grids when the page became a certain size and content started to overlap with each other. This caused me little to no issue and was mostly tedious as I had to copy and paste and rearrange the grid template areas of most of the pages.

The only two pages I didn’t add content to where the donate and contact us pages which are set up as dummy links. The reason these pages don’t have content is that I ran out of time and couldn’t figure out how to add text boxes that would add information to a notepad or other external program. These site other wise would have been filled with boxes to either gather payment data (Donate page) or to send and email directly from the page to the event organizers (contact us)

Most of the design for my webpages didn’t draw direct inspiration for other pages but instead I tried to follow a few core principals I saw other websites following, they were 

1.	Minimize dead space 
    a.	Try and minimize the amount of space wasted on the page so the viewer is almost always looking at either content or an animatic of some sort.
2.	Avoid repeating content on a page
    a.	Try to avoid repeating stuff like social media links, images, and paragraphs on the same page multiple times 
3.	Don’t cram the content 
    a.	Don’t layout the content in a way that is cramped or too congested 

These three principals are most of what I used to restructure the contour 556 website so it was more appealing to potential viewers


I found throughout most of this assignment that while I understood the basic elements of html and css I struggled with some of the more advanced concepts such as gridding and nested gridding which held me back form progressing some time, otherwise I found this assessment to be an interesting and fun was to demonstrate my knowledge of html and css in a practical way. If I had more time to work on my site I would have added more beautifying elements such as a hamburger menu to my navbar (I would have had to restructure my navbar to do this which is why it didn’t happen), I would have worked on adding content to my about us and donate pages, and I would have worked more with nested grids with in nested grids to make pages such as the news page and the people page look neater.
